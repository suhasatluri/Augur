**V1.2: ASX Earnings Surprise Predictor** — spawns 50 autonomous
analyst agents, seeds them with proprietary ASX data extracted from
official earnings PDFs, runs a multi-round debate, returns a probability
distribution of earnings beat/miss before the company reports.

## Status
V1.2 — proprietary ASX data pipeline complete. Augur now reads official
Appendix 4D/4E PDFs directly from ASX announcements and company IR pages.
Company intel harvester fetches quarterly updates and investor presentations
as leading indicators between reporting seasons.
